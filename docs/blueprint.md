## Core Features:

- Hero Section: Displays a prominent introduction with Sharmila S's name and profession, designed with a liquid button for calls to action.
- About Section: Presents a biography with a focus on clean and functional design, showcased in a two-column grid with a tilt card for a profile image.
- Skills Showcase: Visualizes skills through floating glass bubbles that react to hover with subtle physics-like animations.
- Projects Gallery: Arranges projects in a dynamic masonry or bento grid with thick glass cards and a 'glare' effect on hover to enhance interaction.
- Contact Form: Provides a centered contact form with input fields styled as engraved cutouts within the glass surface, complemented by a high-gloss submit button.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark grayish-blue (#4A5568) to enhance the 'Apple-style Premium' feel without being overtly bright or trendy. The slightly desaturated blue provides a professional look, suitable for a portfolio.
- Background color: For light mode, off-white (#F5F5F7); for dark mode, deep black (#050505).
- Accent color: A muted violet (#A371F7), lighter and more saturated than the primary color, which can draw attention to important elements without overpowering the user.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif. It is chosen for its neutrality, making it suitable for both headlines and body text, and its ability to maintain readability across different devices.
- Use Lucide React icons for a consistent and modern look. Icons should be simple and easily recognizable.
- Utilize a 'Liquid Grid' layout with perfect whitespace to separate sections clearly. All elements must feature pill-shaped or deeply rounded corners (rounded-full or rounded-3xl).
- Employ Framer Motion for smooth scroll, layout animations, and hover states. Implement the shrinking Navbar and interactive elements with physics-like behavior.
